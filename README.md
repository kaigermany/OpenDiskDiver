# OpenDiskDiver
Open toolbox for drive and file inspection and recovery


## TODO list:
- Module System
- GUI/CLI
- disk drive format parsers:
    - FAT
    - NTFS
    - ext
- other parsers planned:
    - VDI
    - ZIP
    - ...

All format implementations should be written in such a way that they can handle dead data sectors as good as technically possible.
